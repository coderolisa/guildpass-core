GuildPass provides **wallet-based membership and token-gated community infrastructure** for the Web3 / EVM ecosystem.

This monorepo contains a runnable MVP backend and protocol foundation. It is intentionally not feature-complete, but is real, demoable, and extendable.

> **Part of the [Adamantine-Guild](https://github.com/Adamantine-Guild) project.**

## Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apps/access-api` | Fastify REST API (TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, OpenAPI) |
| `packages/contracts` | TypeScript helpers for on-chain contract addresses and ABIs |
| `packages/shared-types` | Shared types and enums for roles, membership, and decisions |
| `packages/policy-engine` | Simple, explainable access policy engine |
| `packages/sdk-lite` | Minimal HTTP client for the access API |
| `contracts/` | Foundry Solidity project (MembershipNFT + tests + deploy scripts) |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+
- Docker (for PostgreSQL and Redis)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (for Solidity contracts)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter the repo
git clone https://github.com/Adamantine-Guild/guildpass-core.git
cd guildpass-core

# 2. Start PostgreSQL and Redis
docker compose up -d

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — set DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, etc.

# 5. Generate Prisma client and run migrations
npm run -w access-api prisma:migrate

# 6. Seed the database with sample data
npm run seed

# 7. Start the API in development mode
npm run dev
```

OpenAPI docs available at: **http://localhost:3000/docs**

## Contracts (Solidity / Foundry)

The `MembershipNFT` is a simple ERC-721 with expiry and suspension semantics, and admin-controlled mint/renew. It emits events suitable for off-chain indexing.

```bash
# Build contracts
npm run contracts:build   # runs: forge build

# Test contracts
npm run contracts:test    # runs: forge test

# Deploy (example script)
npm run contracts:deploy  # runs: forge script contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol --broadcast
```

After deploying, set `MEMBERSHIP_NFT_ADDRESS` and `CHAIN_ID` in `.env`.

---

## API Endpoints (MVP)

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/v1/memberships/:wallet` | Membership status summary by wallet |
| GET | `/v1/members/:wallet` | Member profile (with membership and roles) |
| POST | `/v1/access/check` | Access decision for `{ wallet, communityId, resource }` |
| GET | `/v1/communities/:communityId/members` | Admin member listing |

Responses include `allowed`/`denied` plus human-readable and machine-readable reasons.

---

## Data Model

Prisma schema includes: `communities`, `wallets`, `members`, `memberships`, `roles`, `access policies`, `profiles`, `badges` (placeholder).

---

## Policy Engine

Simple rules: `PUBLIC`, `MEMBERS_ONLY`, `ADMINS_ONLY`, `CONTRIBUTORS_OR_ADMINS`.

Role resolution combines:
- Membership state (adds `member` role when active)
- Backend role assignments
- Room for future manual override rules (TODO)

---

## Testing

```bash
# Policy engine unit tests
npm run -w @guildpass/policy-engine test

# All workspaces
npm run test

# TypeScript type checking
npm run typecheck
```

---

## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

---

## Environment

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for all required variables.

---

## Deferred Areas (Intentionally Not Implemented)

- Advanced governance permissions
- Constitutional rule engine
- Complex moderation workflows / appeals / reinstatement
- Rich reward distribution and advanced streak logic
- Contribution scoring engine
- Full event attendance ingestion
- Multi-chain support (current: EVM only)
- Advanced indexing pipeline

Clear interfaces and TODOs are left where appropriate.

---

## Development Notes

- Business logic lives in services and the policy engine, not route handlers.
- Contracts and API are aligned via shared types and simple event ABI.
- The code aims to be small and understandable; extending should not require rewrites.
